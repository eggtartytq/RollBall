Finished:
1. Add main menu
2. I use SceneManager for the Scene change, there is a script called SceneLoad, 
    1) Creat a new gameObject( called SceneLoader) and pull the script to the object
    2) In the Botton -> add onClick -> pull the SceneLoader tto onClick (under the runtime) 
    3) Select  SceneLoader ---> LoadScene(string)
    4) type the scene name
ToDO:
1. Score board
2. I am think about add a frame that you can choose back to menu or next round or try again after you finish a game.
